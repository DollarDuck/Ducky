# Dollar Ducky

Dollar Ducky is a personal finance app that helps you keep track of your budgets, bills, and spending. It also helps you plan for large purchases or major life decisions like going back to grad school.

If you'd like to try out our app, sign in as a new user and connect a bank account with our sandbox credentials: choose any bank and input the username: user_good and password: pass_good. This will allow you to view a budget and transaction/spending history based on this fake data. You can also try out the bills calendar, purchase planner, and grad school analyzer with your own inputs.
